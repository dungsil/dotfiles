## Commit Message Convention

- Follow the Conventional Commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- The allowed `type` values are `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, and `revert`.
- Write the `subject` in Korean as a declarative sentence, limit it to 80 characters, and do not end it with a period.
- The `scope` is optional. Use an English lowercase module or domain name (for example, `auth`, `api`, or `ui`).
- Do not include issue numbers in the commit title.
- In the `body`, explain why the change is necessary instead of listing files, and wrap lines at 120 characters. Omit the `body` when the `subject` is sufficient.
- For a breaking change, add `!` after the `type` (for example, `feat!:`) and explain the migration procedure in the `body`.
- A `revert` commit must include the original commit hash in the `body`.
